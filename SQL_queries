Using an Inner Join

SELECT country,
       SUM(amount) AS total_payment
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
INNER JOIN payment E ON a.customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY country
LIMIT 10

		SUM(amount) AS amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
