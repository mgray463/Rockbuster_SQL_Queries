In the first project, this data analyst was tasked with assisting a movie rental company (Rockbuster Stealth LLC) to start a streaming service by looking at their data and answering some vital questions. Using SQL to look at the data and Tableau to create visualizations, we answered questions such as "Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?" and "Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?".
